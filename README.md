# H-AI_collab_game
## Collaborative Human- RL agent game 

### Description
A human-RL agent collaborative game in a [graphical environment](https://github.com/ligerfotis/MazeUnity). This is an extension of [this work](https://github.com/ligerfotis/maze3d_collaborative).

The environment is build in Unity and communicates with the experiment via an HTTP server.

Collaborative Learning is achieved through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The Soft-Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm is used [2] with modifications for discrete action space [3].

### Experiment Set Up
The set-up consists of 3 components:
1. The [Maze Server](https://github.com/panos-stavrianos/maze_server): Dedicated HTTP server that takes data from the experiment (mazeRL) and passes them to the Unity environment (mazeUnity) and vice versa.
2. The online version of the [MazeRL](https://github.com/ligerfotis/maze_RL_online) experiment: Includes the training loops, the RL agent and different configuration files.
3. The graphical environment [MazeUnity](https://github.com/ligerfotis/MazeUnity): A simulation of the real world experiment from Shafti et al. (2020) [1]

The pipeline to start an experiment is described bellow:
* Start the dedicated [Maze-Server](https://github.com/panos-stavrianos/maze_server)
  * Can be started after MazeRL has started
  * If started before MazeRL has it will wait for it to connect.
  * Receives a configuration file from MazeRL and delivers it to MazeUnity upon startup of the latter.
  * Can be in the same machine with MazeRL (recommended for reduced delay) or in a standalone server (docker instructions in its repo).
  
* Start the experiment [MazeRL](https://github.com/ligerfotis/maze_RL_online) (See [Run MazeRL](#run-mazerl))

* Open the graphical environment [MazeUnity](https://github.com/ligerfotis/MazeUnity)

MazeUnity receives actions (plus other important information) and sends back observations (plus other important information) to MazeRL.

The above messages are being exchanged via the HTTP server ([Maze-Server](https://github.com/panos-stavrianos/maze_server)).

MazeRL and MazeUnity work as HTTP clients.

### Installation
* Run `source install_dependencies/install.sh`. 
  - A python virtual environment will be created and the necessary libraries will be installed.
  - Furthermore, the directory of the repo will be added to the `PYTHONPATH` environmental variable.

### Run MazeRL

* Run `python game/sac_maze3d_train.py game/config/<config_sac> <participant_name>` for human-agent game.
  * Example:
    
        python game/sac_maze3d_train.py game/config/config_sac_28K_O-O-a_descending.yaml participant_1

  * Notes before training: 
     * Set the <participant_name> to the name of the participant.
     * The program will create a `/tmp` and a `/plot` folder (if they do not exist) in the `results/` folder. The `/tmp` folder contains CSV files with information of the game. The `/plot` folder contains figures for tha game. See [here](#Experiment-Result-Output-Files) for more details.
     * The program will automatically create an identification number after your name on each folder name created
    
### Configuration

#### Game Configuration
* In the game/config folder several YAML files exist for the configuration of the experiment. The main parameters are listed below.
    * `game:discrete_input`: True if the keyboard input is discrete (False for continuous). Details regarding the discrete and continuous human input mode can be found [here](https://github.com/ligerfotis/maze_RL_v2/blob/master/game)
    * `SAC:reward_function`: Type of reward function. Details about the predefined reward functions and how to define a new one can be found [here](https://github.com/ligerfotis/maze_RL_v2/blob/master/game).
    * `Experiment:mode`: Choose how the game will be terminated; either when a number of games, or a number of interactions is completed.
    * `SAC:discrete`: Discrete or normal SAC (Currently only the discrete SAC is compatible with the game)
    

#### Components Connectivity Configuration
* `game/network_config.yaml` contains the information of where to locate each component of the set-up (Maze_RL, Maze-Server and [MazeUnity](https://github.com/ligerfotis/MazeUnity)). This is sent upon connection set up to Maze-Server and from Maze-Server consequently to MazeUnity.
    * (if applicable)`ip_distributor`: the location of an instance of the [Maze-Server](https://github.com/panos-stavrianos/maze_server), that MazeUnity first speaks to, in order to know where to look for Maze-Server. 
      Can be located either on a remote server or locally (same machine as MazeRL).
      Its purpose is to allow the Maze-Server or MazeRL moving to different locations.
    If there is no need to be used, [MazeUnity](https://github.com/ligerfotis/MazeUnity) can be set up to locate directly Maze-Server
    * `maze_server`: the location of the maze-server.
    * `maze_rl`: the location of mazeRL.
* Set **ALL** to `localhost` for playing the game locally. Otherwise, set a static IP (e.g. duckdns.org) and open the appropriate ports on your router.
  
### Play
Directions of how to play the game are given in [MazeUnity](https://github.com/ligerfotis/MazeUnity).
